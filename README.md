# Biopython-Search-for-Green-Algae
# Lets answer the following questions:
1. How many results do you get when you search for full 28 rRNA genes that are over 700 bp from a) nematode, b) a green algae species, and c) an ascomycete fungus? (Give a different number for a, b, and c). Please use python to answer this - Hint: use the [gene] tag and print (records['Count'])
2. Save all 28 rRNA genes that are over 700 bp from all green algae species to a file named "long_28rrna_greenalgae.fa"
